# Welcome

Thank you for thinking about contributing to the *Brains For Publication* [2016 OHBM Hackathon](http://events.brainhack.org/OHBM2016/) project!

At time of writing (4th April 2016) this page is still under construction, but it will grow into some guidelines on how to contribute to the project. It was created by [Kirstie](https://github.com/KirstieJane) but all edits are very welcome!

It complements the [README](https://github.com/KirstieJane/BrainsForPublication/blob/master/README.md) file which gives more information about the goals of the project.

## Not Yet Curated

If you have some code that makes pretty brain pictures please upload it into the [NotYetCurated](https://github.com/KirstieJane/BrainsForPublication/tree/master/NotYetCurated) folder. Please upload all the comments and documentation that you have, but don't worry if it's just a snippet at the moment! One of the goals for the hackathon is to work on making all our individual hard work easy to access by others.

Once your code is in the folder, you could open an [issue](#issues) to describe what it does and suggest any work that could be done to make it even better.

## Issues

Although GitHub calls them ***issues***, I like to think of them as ***conversation starters***. You can use them for anything, asking questions, sharing links to suggestions, starting work plans, whatever you fancy! They're a great tool to allow us to work collaboratively and get feedback on our ideas.

Remember that we all love to receive positive feedback, so please be liberal with your [reactions](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) to any suggestions. :+1: :smile: :heart: :tada:

## Pull requests

If you'd like to contribute documentation or code to the project you can open a [pull request](https://github.com/KirstieJane/BrainsForPublication/pulls).

Before you put lots of work into your code, it's a good idea to open an issue describing the work you're planning to contribute to make sure we aren't reinventing the wheel or duplicating work that is already underway. This is a lovely [blog post](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) that explains how everyone benefits from this upfront work.

If you need any help submiting a pull request you can ask Kirstie on [Slack](https://brainhack.slack.com/messages/brains4publication/), in a GitHub issue (@KirstieJane), on [twitter](https://twitter.com/kirstie_j/) or by email (kw401 AT cam DOT ac DOT uk). She's happy to help and really passionate about making everyone in the team feel comfortable irregardless of their prior GitHub expertise!

## Acknowledging contributions

Everyone's work is important, whether you provide feedback on an issue by giving it a little :+1:, you suggest refinements to some documentation, you comment someone else's code, or make it generalisable to your use, the project is stronger when we have a range of people helping out.

We have a [Let's Build a Hat Rack](https://labhr.github.io/hatrack/#repo=KirstieJane/BrainsForPublication) page that shows everyone who has contributed to the project. You can find out more about Let's Build a Hat Rack at their [home page](http://labhr.github.io/).

We also maintain a table of the key contributors in our [README](README.md) file. It follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification using an [emoji-key](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors#emoji-key) for a variety of different contributions! If you've contributed, please add yourself to that table :sparkles::sparkles::sparkles:
